## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Java 17 + Spring Boot
- Maven
- Docker
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- K8 YAMLs

---

## 🔁 Branch Strategy

- `develop`: for staging deployments
- `master`: for production deployments

Each branch triggers:
- Maven build
- Docker image build and tag: `ghcr.io/loayghreep/java-k8s-demo:{branch}`
- Simulated deploy to EKS via `kubectl apply` and `kubectl set image`
- Deployments to EKS is mocked with `echo`, but can be activated by replacing with real credentials and uncommenting the commands

---

## ⚙️ Deployment Flow

1. Build the app via Maven
2. Dockerize with multi-stage Dockerfile
3. Tag image with branch name
4. Simulate deployment:
   - `aws eks update-kubeconfig`
   - `kubectl apply -f k8s/*.yaml`
   - `kubectl set image ...` for rolling update
